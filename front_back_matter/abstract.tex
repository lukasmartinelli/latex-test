\chapter*{Abstract} % Abstract name

Creating a custom styled OSM map is one of the most common use cases
among cartographers, yet it is very difficult to do so. With the provided 
free and open source vector tiles it possible to allow anyone to
create their custom OSM maps without having a deep knowledge of vector tiles.
\\\\
In this thesis a workflow to create vector tiles from \osm{} data has been defined and publicly documented, allowing other developers to adapt the workflow and use it for their own vector tiles.
The vector tiles are compatible with Mapbox products and therefore provide an easy migration path for companies that want to use free vector tiles but still use existing tools and technologies.
\\\\
The vector tiles are provided as public download on the project website \url{http://osm2vectortiles.org} allowing anyone to download the data and build custom maps and solutions on top of it without being bound to an external service.
