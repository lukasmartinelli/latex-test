\chapter*{Abstract} % Abstract name

Creating a custom styled OSM map is one of the most common use cases among cartographers
yet it is very difficult to do so. With the new emerging technology of vector tiles it
is possible to allow anyone to create their custom OSM maps without downloading the
entire database and managing complex infrastructure. The task of this project is to
make this as easy as possible.
