This is necessary to show the added value of our project and help the understanding.

\subsection*{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Creating a custom styled OSM map is one of the most common use cases
among cartographers yet it is very difficult to do so. With the new
emerging technology of vector tiles it is possible to allow anyone to
create their custom OSM maps without downloading the entire database and
managing complex infrastructure. The task of this project is to make
this as easy as possible.

\subsection*{Approach / Technologies}

Our project is focused on creating a free and Open Source vector tiles
of Open Street Map that can easily used by developers, cartographers and
designers to create their custom maps.

Through the use of Docker we can provide workflows that don't need a
complicate setup and are deployable across operating systems.

\subsection*{Result}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Docker Container to create vector tiles (MBTiles with PBF) from OSM
\item
  Docker Container to serve vector tiles together with custom styles as
  raster data
\end{itemize}
