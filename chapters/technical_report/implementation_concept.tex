\chapter{Implementation Concept}

All objectives which we defined in \hyperref[targets]{\emph{section 1.2}} have been achieved. The optional target to provide vector tiles for the whole world has been moved to our bachelor thesis.

\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We created Docker Containers for every task in the process of creating vector tiles.
\item
  We created a vector tile server to serve the vector tiles together with a visual style.
\item
  We provide a project website with information on how to use our vector tiles.
\end{itemize}

The vector tiles for Switzerland can be downloaded from our project website (http://osm2vectortiles.org). These vector tiles can be served together with a visual style in our vector tiles server.

A custom visual style can be created with Mapbox Studio Classic\footnote{\url{https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio-classic/}}.

\section{Future}
In a first step the project should be expanded to provide vector tiles for the entire world. We need to figure out how we can scale our vector tile rendering workflow.

When we presented our project to members of the Swiss OSM community, they asked if the vector tiles get updated. There should definitely be a way to identify and rerender outdated vector tiles.

As the long-term vision of this project is to provide a complete offline map, we would like to implement basic GeoName search.

This suggests will be the project goals for our bachelor thesis.
