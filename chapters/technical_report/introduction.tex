\chapter{Introduction}

%-------------------------------------------------------

Creating a custom styled OSM map is one of the most common use cases
among cartographers yet it is very difficult to do so. With the new
emerging technology of vector tiles it is possible to allow anyone to
create their custom OSM maps without setting up a database and
managing complex infrastructure.

\section{Vision}\label{part1_vision}

Michal Migurski published on March 15, 2013 a blog
post\footnote{\url{http://mike.teczno.com/notes/postgreslessness-mapnik-vectiles.html}},
in which he described his first attempts to use vector tiles as a source
for the Mapnik tile renderer and his vision for vector tiles.
\newline{}
Vector tiles only contain geometries and metadata.
The visual style is applied on the fly when the tile is requested, it is separated from the
actual vector data. Vector tiles are smaller than raster tiles, this enables high resolution maps, fast map loads and efficient caching.\footnote{ \url{https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/}} \\
Our mission is to bring the power of vector tiles to anyone and provide
the data free and as Open Source project.

\section{Goals}\label{goals}

The main goal of this thesis is to allow anyone to create their custom
OSM map without managing complex infrastructure. In order to complete this goal
several deliverables were defined in the project proposal.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Create workflow to create vector tiles from \osm{} data
\item
  Provide vector tiles for Switzerland
\item
  Provide method to serve the vector tiles together with
  custom styles as raster tiles
\item
  Optional: Vector tiles for the entire world
\end{itemize}
