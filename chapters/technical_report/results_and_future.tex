\chapter{Results and Future}

All objectives which we defined in \hyperref[targets]{\emph{section 1.2}} have been achieved. The optional target to provide vector tiles for the whole world has been moved to our bachelor thesis.

\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We created Docker Containers for every task in the process of creating vector tiles.
\item
  We created a vector tile server to serve the vector tiles together with a visual style.
\item
  We provide a project website with information on how to use our vector tiles.
\end{itemize}

The vector tiles for Switzerland can be downloaded from our project website (http://osm2vectortiles.org). These vector tiles can be served together with a visual style in our vector tiles server.

A custom visual style can be created with Mapbox Studio Classic\footnote{\url{https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio-classic/}}.

\section{Future}
In a first step the project should be expanded to provide vector tiles for the entire world. This makes the project When we showed the vector tiles to members of the OSM community, they sad it would be very useful if the vector tiles could be updated with new OSM data.
