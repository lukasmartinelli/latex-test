\section{User Characteristics}
\label{user-characteristics}

There are two user groups interested in this project:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Map Designer}: A technically versed person using Windows or
  OSX which has knowledge of GIS software but not necessarily of it's
  inner technical workings.
\item
  \textbf{System Administrator}: The person who needs to host the
  published maps.
\end{itemize}

A System Administrator 

\section{Non Functional Requirements}
\label{non-functional-requirements}

The most important NFR in this scenario is usability. If we cannot get
usability right no one will use our solution.

\paragraph{Learnability}

Map designers should not have to learn how to use the command line in
order to use Docker.

\paragraph{Repeatable}

Generating OSM vector tiles must be possible any time because OSM
updates regularly.

\paragraph{Performance}

The tileserver must handle 10 concurrent user per second.

\paragraph{Compatibility}

The vector tiles must contain all feature sets Mapbox Streets contain. If we can guarantee full compatibility with Mapbox Streets\footnote{\url{https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/mapbox-streets-v6/}}} all Mapbox visual styles can be used with our vector tiles.
